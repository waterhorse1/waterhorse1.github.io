I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Computer Science, University College London, advised by Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). My research interests focus on Large Language Model, Meta Reinforcement Learning and Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
