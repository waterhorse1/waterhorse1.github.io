I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Computer Science, University College London, advised by Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). My research interests lie in Large Language Model, Single-agent/Multi-agent and Meta Reinforcement Learning.

Previously I did my undergraduate at the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University.
