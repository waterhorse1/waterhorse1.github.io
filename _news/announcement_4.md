Our new work [Alphazero-like Tree-Search can Guide Large Language Model Decoding and Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17179) has been accepted by the NeurIPS 2023 FMDM workshop, check our [codebase](https://github.com/waterhorse1/LLM_Tree_Search). In this paper, we systematically discuss how we can do AlphaZero-like tree search to enhance LLM inference and training.
