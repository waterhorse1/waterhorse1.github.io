I am a Research Scientist in [Google DeepMind](https://deepmind.google/). I am graduating from Computer Science, University College London, advised by Prof. [Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/jun.wang/). Previously I did my undergraduate at the Department of Automation, Tsinghua University.

My research interests lie in Large Language Model, Single-agent/Multi-agent and Meta Reinforcement Learning.
